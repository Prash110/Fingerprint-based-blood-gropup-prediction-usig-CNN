# Fingerprint-based-blood-gropup-prediction-usig-CNN
This project proposes a non-invasive blood group detection method using fingerprint patterns. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and advanced image processing, it analyzes fingerprint features to predict blood types, offering a rapid, accessible, and accurate alternative to traditionalÂ methods.
